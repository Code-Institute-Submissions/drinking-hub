        <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (“PII”) is being used online or with mobile applications.

If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify visitors by posting an announcement on the website. Your continued use of the website and/or mobile app after an update to the Privacy Policy is published or otherwise communicated to you shall constitute your consent to the changes. Otherwise, you should not continue accessing the website or app. This policy is effective as of July, 12 2020.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
        <p>Please note that no website can guarantee absolute security of data. We cannot guarantee or warrant the security of information you disclose or transmit to and through our website and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of information. We highly recommend that visitors keep their computers secure.</p>
        <h3>Do we use ‘cookies’?</h3>
        <p>A cookie is a small file that asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added, and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.</p>
        <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
        <h3>Third-party disclosure</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your PII unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
        <h3>Third-party links</h3>
        <p>Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting such sites, and this privacy policy does not govern such sites. Since we do not control the privacy policies of any third party, you should investigate its policy before you disclose your personal information to them.</p>

        <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
        <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
        <p>Our website is for adults. When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>
        <p>We do not market to children. If we discover we have received any information from a person who is under the age of majority in violation of the law, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe that we have any information from or about anyone under the age of majority, please contact us immediately.</p>
