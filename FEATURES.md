## Features

### Site Wide 
    - The base of the website is primarily made up of landing page, which explains the purpose of the site, the cocktails page, which shows all the added drink recipes and the 'Add Your Own' page, which allows the user to creat and add there own creations. The use of the Jinja templating language allowed me to implement a consistent layout throughout the site using a 'base.html' file and 'block content'. I was able to build a footer and complex, responsive navbar, with an animated 'burger' icon drop down menu for smaller screen sizes for the 'base.html' page. The use of this allowed me to show the header and footer on every page without having to rewrite any code.    

- ##### The Navigation Bar
    - The navigation bar is fully responsive and is aesthetically pleasing on all platforms and devices. 
    
    - On desktop view (screen width size of 992px and above) the brand name is located at the far left-hand side of the navigation bar followed by the links to the other pages.

    - On tablet view (screen width sizes between 992px to 767px), all the links still fit on a single line and looks good, so no changed are needed.

    - On mobile view & smaller screen sized devices (screen width sizes under 767px) the logo remains over the left-hand side however, the links are replaced by a 'hamburger' icon which stays over to the right. On click of this icon, the 'burger' animates and all the links slide in from the top. The background of this slide in menu is slightly transparent so the user can still see the content, but dark enough so the links stand out and can be seen clearly. 

- ##### The Footer
    - The footer is fairly basic but still necessary. It contains the copyright information for the website as-well-as links for the contact page and privacy policy.

    - The footer is also fully responsive, however, there are no changes as we go down the display sizes as it is not necessary.
